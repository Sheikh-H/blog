Hey there! I’m an aspiring developer with a passion for **full-stack development, Python projects, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity** 💻🔒.

Coding isn’t just work for me—it’s a puzzle I LOVE solving 🧩. I’ll sit with a tricky problem for days (or weeks 😅), until I crack it.

This blog is my journey back into tech 🚀. I left university more than 5 years ago and, like many, found the tech industry tough to break into. I ended up in customer service and sales—but a spark reignited my love for coding. Now I’m relearning, experimenting, and sharing everything I discover along the way ✨.

Here, you’ll find posts about what I’m learning, the latest tech trends, and updates from the coding and cybersecurity world 🌐. Think of it as my personal lab notes—sometimes serious, sometimes funny, always real.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me **geeking out over the latest gadgets 📱, socialising 🗣️, golfing ⛳, or trying delicious food 🍣**.

Dive in, explore, and maybe even share a laugh 😂. Curious about my work? Check out my portfolio through the tabs above!
