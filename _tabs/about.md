Hey There! I’m an aspiring developer with a passion for full-stack development, Python projects, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity.

Coding is more than work—it’s a puzzle I enjoy solving. I’ll often spend days exploring a problem until I figure it out.

This is my first blog, created to document my learning and experiments in tech 🚀. I left university over five years ago and, like many, found it challenging to break into the tech industry. I spent some time in customer service and sales, but my interest in coding never faded. Now, I’m relearning, experimenting, and sharing everything I discover along the way. I strongly believe in using these skills responsibly and would never apply them for unethical purposes.

Here, you’ll find posts about what I’m learning, updates from the tech and cybersecurity world, and reflections on my journey. Think of it as my personal lab notes—practical, insightful, and honest.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new gadgets, socialising, golfing, and trying different cuisines 🍣.

Sometimes I'll post without including all the bits of information I have on them, this is to allow readers to get in touch and enable me to improve my learning on any topic. While also I will post using a lot of AI content as it helps speed up the process to my learning, writing, and posting.

What I want to achieve with using AI in my learning is the ability to break a topic down, have it rewritten in a format that everyone is able to relate to and then reword it myself. I think that using AI in the right way helps boost productivity and enhances creativity, which we all need!

Dive in, explore, and maybe even share a laugh 😂. Curious about my work? Check out my portfolio through the tabs on the left! 👈
