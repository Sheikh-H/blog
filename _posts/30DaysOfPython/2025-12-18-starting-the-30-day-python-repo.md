I wanted to sit down and go over a course[^f1] that taught me to code with Python in just a month, as some of the concepts and methods discussed, were very in-depth and hands on. The course gets you to go over one topic a day and use that as your milestone to learn the basics of the programming language.

However, it could take you longer or shorter depending on you.

If you want to go on ahead and try the course yourself, I've placed the link in the footnotes for you!

Below you'll find a list of all what is taught and a link to the page of me explaining or re-explaining the topic to myself:
