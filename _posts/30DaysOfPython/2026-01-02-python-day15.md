title: Python Errors Made Simple - How to Read Them, Fix Them, and Keep Your Code Running
description: >-
  Error messages are part of learning to code. In this post, I explore the most common Python errors, what they actually mean, and how to respond to them calmly and logically. The aim isn’t to memorise every error, but to build a mindset that helps debug issues and write more resilient code.

Type Errors are just an accumulated collection of the most common errors you'll encounter while coding in Python. This topic is a little easier to digest than what we have been discussing so far. It's important to know about the different type errors as they'll immediately improve your response to debugging and acknowledging.

All errors are printed out into the terminal and point to the line of code where the problem is to which you can attend to which makes debugging easier.
By this point in our coding journey, we need to be able to know how to read these errors and fix them.

Here are the most common Type Errors built with AI to help speed up the process of discussing them all:

| Error Type              | What It Means                                                                                                              | Example                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SyntaxError**         | Your code does not follow Python’s grammar rules. This happens when you miss parentheses, colons, quotes, or indentations. | `print 'hello'` → Python expects parentheses: `print('hello')`                     |
| **NameError**           | You tried to use a variable or function that hasn’t been defined yet.                                                      | `print(age)` when `age` hasn’t been created. Fix: `age = 25` then `print(age)`     |
| **IndexError**          | You are trying to access an item in a list, tuple, or string that is out of range.                                         | `numbers = [1,2,3]; numbers[3]` → valid indices are 0,1,2                          |
| **ModuleNotFoundError** | Python cannot find the module you are trying to import.                                                                    | `import maths` → Python cannot find `maths`. Correct: `import math`                |
| **AttributeError**      | You tried to use a property or method that doesn’t exist for an object.                                                    | `math.PI` → the correct attribute is `math.pi`                                     |
| **KeyError**            | You tried to access a key in a dictionary that does not exist.                                                             | `user = {'name':'Sheikh'}; user['age']` → Key `'age'` does not exist               |
| **TypeError**           | You used an operation on a value of the wrong type.                                                                        | `4 + '3'` → cannot add number and string. Fix: `4 + int('3')`                      |
| **ImportError**         | Python cannot import a specific function or class from a module.                                                           | `from math import power` → there is no `power` in math. Use `from math import pow` |
| **ValueError**          | You passed a value of the right type but it has an invalid value for the operation.                                        | `int('12a')` → `'12a'` cannot be converted to an integer                           |
| **ZeroDivisionError**   | You tried to divide a number by zero, which is not allowed in maths.                                                       | `1/0` → Python raises `ZeroDivisionError`                                          |

## Discussion

I want to avoid spending too much time on this topic as it's more used as general feedback to the developer. We need a brief understanding of how errors are made, how to avoid them, how to read error prompts and fix them. The best method to follow when it comes to coding is to code using functions and variables that handles errors gracefully like:

1. Return `None` or a `default value` instead of letting the program crash.
2. Return `True`/`False` (booleans) to indicate success or failure.
3. Use `try, except` code blocks later on to catch and manage exceptions.

This method of development will help keep your code running smooth even if there are any errors and enhance your abilities when it comes to debugging.
