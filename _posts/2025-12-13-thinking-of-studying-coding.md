The tech industry is filled with software developers, engineers, and data scientists — all **manipulating technology to improve human lives** in one way or another.

But as everyday people, a question naturally arises:

**Where do we fit in? - Other than being consumers...**

What can we do that allows us to use the *same tools* to create something meaningful — or even profitable?

We constantly see headlines about blue-chip organisations making breakthroughs using data, automation, or artificial intelligence to “transform your *virtual* experience.”
But what does that *actually* mean for us?

These were the exact questions that lived rent-free in my mind for years. And if you’re reading this, chances are - you’ve thought about them too.

That curiosity is what pushed me to study technology in the first place.

# A Not-So-Perfect Start (And Why That’s Okay)

I’ll be upfront:
I didn’t get the best grades.
I didn’t land the career I hoped for.

For a while, it felt like I had failed.

But instead of killing my interest, that experience **fuelled it.**

Fast-forward a few years, and I found myself diving back into coding — this time on my own terms. As of writing this, I’ve spent **over a year relearning how to code**, approaching it differently, more intentionally, and with far more patience.

The path was long.
It was often tedious.
But I’ve always enjoyed a challenge.

And now, having walked through that road again, I can confidently share what genuinely helped — and what didn’t.

The reason you’re reading this post is simple:

> Teaching something once is learning it twice.

This blog exists as my learning journal — a place where I “pretend” to teach, but really, I’m reinforcing what I’m learning myself.

Before diving into tools and resources, there’s one thing that matters more than anything else.

# Mind Before Matter

If you want a realistic shot at becoming an entry-level programmer, **mindset is non-negotiable**.

## The Power of Deep Work

You need the ability to focus deeply.

The idea of *deep work* was popularised by thinkers like **Carl Jung** and later expanded on by **Cal Newport**. At its core, it’s the ability to work on a single task — uninterrupted — for extended periods (60–90 minutes).

This kind of focus is where real learning happens.

## Your Brain Needs Fuel

Mental performance doesn’t exist in isolation.

Exercise regularly

Socialise

Do things that make you feel **competent**

This isn’t about making you become some hyper-optimised productivity machine that looks and feels like Michael B. Jordan.
Plenty of successful programmers look… questionable. 🙂

The point is to unlock your **creative capacity**, because creativity and problem-solving are the real currencies of programming.

## Track What You Learn

You will forget things. Constantly.

That’s normal.

Which is why documenting your learning — through notes, blogs, or repositories — is powerful. Revisiting topics is part of the process, not a failure of intelligence.

Be patient with yourself.

Most successful people follow a *lifestyle* of constantly revisiting topics, doing exams, and learning new topics.

I'm far from successful, but I know why it works.

# Where Should You Begin?

Once the foundations are in place, the obvious question becomes:

**What language should I start with?**

For me, the answer was clear: **Python**.

I had previously learned **C#** and other object-oriented languages during college and university, but Python felt like the missing piece — the language that finally *clicked*.

🔗 https://www.python.org

Python is widely regarded as:

- Beginner-friendly

- Readable

- Incredibly powerful

- One of the *most in-demand* languages in the world

With Python, you can build:

- Task automation scripts

- Simple applications

- Text-based games

- Data analysis tools

And with AI tools like **ChatGPT** acting as a personal tutor, learning has never been more accessible.

At some point, something interesting happens:
You stop thinking about syntax — and start thinking about **solutions**.

That’s when coding becomes creative.

# Learning Styles Matter More Than You Think

Your next step depends on *how* you learn best.

Ask yourself:

- Do I learn visually?

- Do I learn by reading?

- Do I learn by doing?

I’ve tried:

- Free courses

- Paid (funded) courses

- Classroom environments

- Pure self-study

Here’s the truth:

No path is perfect.

Classroom courses leave gaps.
Self-study can feel scattered.

What worked best for me was **structured self-study**.

As I write this, I'm still learning how to create a structured learning program for whatever topic I want to learn, what worked there for me is using AI to help create methods or roadmaps to tackle the larger topic.


# The Resources That Actually Helped
1. A Structured GitHub Challenge

This repository was a game-changer:

🔗 https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python

It takes you from absolute beginner to near 
entry-level in 30 days. By the end, I understood Python better than I had after completing a Level 2 coding course.

1. YouTube — *After the Basics*

Once you've got the basics, course creators like Mosh Hamedani become incredibly valuable.

🔗 https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh

His Python course is beginner-friendly, thorough, and affordable — roughly the price of a few takeaway meals.

1. Immediate Practice

Reading alone isn’t enough.

Whatever you learn:

- Write it

- Break it

- Fix it

- Rewrite it

Learning sticks when your hands are involved.

# What Comes After Python?

If you’re serious about learning to code, there are a few non-negotiables:

Improve your **basic maths** (nothing advanced)

Get comfortable **reading documentation**

Set up a **reliable workspace**

Practice relentlessly

Focus on comfort before expertise.

Rotate your learning:

- One month Python

- One month HTML/CSS

- Back to Python again

This prevents burnout and strengthens retention.

## Algorithms: Don’t Memorise — Understand

You don’t need to memorise algorithms.

You need to understand:

- What problem they solve

- How they work conceptually

- Where they’re used

That understanding compounds over time.

# Tools Worth Bookmarking

W3Schools

🔗 https://www.w3schools.com - Brilliant for HTML, CSS, and quick references.

GitHub

🔗 https://github.com - Explore repositories slowly. One function at a time.

Books

Visit your local library or grab a beginner book. - This will help set the context for you.

Khan Academy

🔗 https://www.khanacademy.org - Ideal for refreshing maths and logic skills.

Online Communities / Forums

Joining as many conversations online about the topic wherever you can will help with your understanding.

# Final Thoughts

I hope that by the end of reading this post I have been able to give you information that you can use to get you on the same learning path that I'm on.

This blog won’t always sound formal.

It’s written to speak to *you*, not at *you*.

If I can relate to where you are right now, then the time you spent reading this was worth it.

I don’t have subscriptions set up yet — but that’ll come.

Until then, this space exists to help me learn, remember, and improve. Because in the end:

> You only truly learn what you use.
