At what point do we sit and tell ourselves to give over? When do we zoom out of perspective and take the path down 'reality'? My journey getting back into coding has been more difficult that it was when I was in uni studying. That's when it hit me...

I bet you're here because you too are trying to learn coding and all about how the world works, online. I bet you've got the keen eye for details and love sitting in your creative spark with a solution to build some program that'll solve some problem. The problem you face is that, you don't know how to build a program.

So you've spent weeks, maybe months - like me, online looking for courses on YouTube or Google and getting recommendations (like this one) from guys online who've succeeded but why aren't you getting anywhere?

Well, that's the catch...

## The online world is a scam!

That's what they'll rather have you believe than let you continue in your studies and I'm writing this blog to show that even the smallest of successes can make for the greatest of journey's.

It needs to be known that learning coding isn't just as straight forward as you could think and that journey you go on to learn it, is imperative to your development.

I know that a lot of what I am saying sounds like I am trying to pull you in as a reader through through your neck only to get you to read this. As true as that could be, it's more to tell you the truth.

In 2012 I started my so called studies into coding and this was my first step in. I needed a solid ground to work from, but like most young teenagers born in a place of poverty not only were my opportunities made limited but so was my learning.

After a tumultuous 7 years of studies from College to Uni, even with achieving feats like earning a first in systems development I only left my studies to end up working as a sales assistant and promised the false British Dream.

I disagreed with that, I wanted back in.

## It's not always easy

This is where I said to myself that I will set the task of learning this whether I earn or don't earn from it. I changed my perspective of how I would like my future to be like 10 years from now. This mean big change and learning in a manner that was 'non-stop'.

**If, by this point, in reading this post you've found enough information, just click out, because what comes next is recommendations...**

The mindset you need to have to achieve a feat as big as this, is that you detach from the desires of wanting to gain something from it. Most of these coders you see online have already gone through that hurdle and have ended up at the other side where their perseverance paid off.

However, to people like you and me we code because that's who we are. They code because they have gained A* in all their qualifications but does that really make for the best coders? Why is it that we have people with A* getting all the best coding careers but if they're so good why do the 'black-hat' hackers win?

What is it about learning yourself that sets you aside from being the A\* coder?

I get it we all want that good coding job and to go round boasting to people but what if we didn't?

It could be absolutely crazy but what if we went silent and got all what we wanted? - Does that make us dangerous?

## Keep on Studying

As an individual born in the crevasses darkness upon darkness in life being silo'd into missing out of important years in my studies I learnt of the single most important lesson that I could ever learn and it all came from re-learning coding.

I want to give you the reality of learning coding and what you have to go through get what you want. WITHOUT SELLING YOUR SOUL...

The trick is, learn on the go.

Don't just sit there and force yourself to learn, rather make a routine.

Don't just sit on YouTube and try different bits and bobs, learn one topic at a time.

Don't just sit and pull your hair out at every 'unsolvable' situation, find the solution by working.

Ever watched the Wolf Of Wall Street? - dumb question I know.

That's what life is really like.

## The grains of success

I brought you here because I wanted to recommend to you as person who is on the same journey as I am to go through what I recommend and tell me \*_personally_\* of what you think.

First, begin with learning a coding language that is 'object-oriented' meaning that you code in blocks. Pre-configured, easy to learn, and hard to master but pays off.

My personal fave - Python.
