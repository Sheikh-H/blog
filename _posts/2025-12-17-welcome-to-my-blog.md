I’ve never been someone who *loved* writing.

Unless I was taking notes, messy and fragmented notes, on whatever I happened to be studying at the time. However,  I loved reading great writing… but I couldn’t *produce* it.

With a **newfound drive to return to coding**, I realised something important:

> If I truly wanted to learn, I needed to *document the process*.

So, here we are.

I don’t know if this will work. **But** I do know one thing—  
*if I can teach it, I can learn it better.*

## Why Writing? Why Blogging?

The idea of blogging has always intrigued me—especially through the lens of **copywriting**, **digital marketing**, and **direct-response advertising**.

The ability to influence someone *from behind a screen* is mind-bending.

It’s a skill that’s existed for as long as advertising itself, and organisations pay *serious money* for people who can do it well.

Great marketers build **sales funnels**.  
Elite copywriters then bring those funnels *to life* using nothing but words.

It’s a rare skill.  
But it’s also one that can be *trained*.

I’ve always known I had a creative side, yet I lacked the vocabulary—and the grammatical confidence—to write at a copywriter’s level.

What I wanted was simple:

> To write as well as I read…  
> and use that skill to speak to people online through valuable content.

## The Learning Problem

Coding is vast.

*Massive*, actually.

There’s an overwhelming amount of information you’re expected to understand—if not outright memorise. And while I’d consider myself fairly good at recalling information, I knew this approach wouldn’t scale.

I needed a better system.

Something that would let me stop *passively taking notes* and start *actively thinking*.

That’s when the idea hit me:

> **A learning journal.**

Interestingly enough, the concept was introduced to me back in university—but I’ll be honest… I was always “on road” (nothing illegal 😄).

## Writing, Speaking, and Sales

Here’s the kicker:

> We can only write as well as we can speak.

Spending years in sales helped me more than I realised. The only real difference between speaking and writing?

You can **iterate** through writing.  
You *can’t* do that with speech.

That insight alone made something click for me:

> Improving my writing would inevitably improve my speaking.

And that’s a win on *every* front.

## Why Blog About Coding?

I’m an entry-level coder—*barely*—with around **12 months of independent research**, not including my formal studies.

There’s no chance I’ll remember everything.

So instead, I blog.

By doing deep dives into topics I’m learning, I force my brain to connect ideas—to *fire neurons together*.

> “Neurons that fire together, wire together.”  
> — Norman Doidge [^f1]

In simpler terms:  
If I can break something down to its most **granular level** and then teach it, I’ll retain it.

And writing about it *is* using the information in one sense.

You may have already stumbled across my modest [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Sheikh-H) or [Portfolio](https://www.sheikh-h.github.io) and have a general idea of what I’m working on. Still, I wanted this post to serve as a **starting point**—especially for those landing here via social media or shared links.

## What You’ll Find Here

Most posts on my blog will fall into one of the following categories:

- **Full-Stack Development**
- **Ethical Hacking**
- **News & Updates**

Yes—there are plenty of blogs that already cover these topics.

But this one?  
This is primarily for *me*.

I need to revisit concepts. Explain them in different ways. Ask and answer the right questions. Learn them again—*properly*.

I’ll also be documenting **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges and ethical hacking practices to better understand *how* systems are secured—and how they fail.

---

If you stick around, read the posts, and share feedback—I’d genuinely appreciate it.

This journal isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about **progress**.

Let me know you're thoughts!
